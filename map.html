Cortona’s architecture is medieval with steep narrow streets situated on a hillside, embracing a view of the whole of the Valdichiana. You will travel through the enchanting Tuscan countryside to the Gothic and Romanesque town of Siena, considered one of the world’s best-preserved medieval cities and a showcase of Italian Gothic. I will take you on a guided tour of the city’s highlights. End your trip with breakfast at a sidewalk cafe, soaking in the splendid views of Montecatini. </p>
