            <h2>Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise</h2>
            <p>The 82nd Infantry Division mistakenly landed directly in the town of Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise at 1:40 a.m., resulting in heavy casualties. Burning buildings illuminated the night sky, making the defenseless paratroopers easy targets and the down-draft from the flames sucked several men into the fires. Other troopers were caught hanging from trees and utility poles and shot before they could cut themselves loose.</p>
            <p>However, the Germans were confused by conflicting reports of allied landings and attacks and retired in the middle of the night. This contributed to the ease by which the 505th PIR took the town by 5:00 a.m. The lightly armed troops held the town against heavy German counter-attacks, finally securing it on June 7th with help from tanks sent from nearby Utah Beach.</p>

          <div class="mapInfo" id="info2">
            <h2>Utah Beach</h2>
            <p>Utah Beach was a staging area to secure the important port facilities at Cherbourg. It was added later in the D-Day planning and necessitated a month-long delay for the assembly of additional l landing crafts. Troops landed in four waves beginning at 6:30 a.m. and were met with minimal resistance. The 4th Infantry Division landed 21,000 troops on Utah suffering only 197 casualties. By the end of June 6th, Allied forces had captured only about half of their objectives, but the beachhead was secure and could be used as an important staging area in subsequent days.</p>
            <p>Cherbourg was captured on June 26, but only after the Germans had destroyed the port facilities. The port was not fully operational until September.</p>

          <div class="mapInfo" id="info3">
            <h2>Omaha Beach</h2>
            <p>Very little went according to plan at Omaha Beach. Most of the landing craft missed their targets and came up against unexpectedly-strong opposition. Under heavy fire, army engineers worked to clear beach obstacles but the time required to clear the beach caused subsequent landing crafts to bunch up and obstruct the clear landing channels.
            </p>
            <p>Eventually small groups of survivors were able to improvise an assault on the entrenched German troops. By the end of June 6, two isolated footholds on the beach were achieved and were exploited over the next several days as the invasion forces moved inland.</p>

          <div class="mapInfo" id="info4">
            <h2>Gold Beach</h2>
            <p>The British landing at Gold Beach was designed to link up with forces at Omaha Beach and move inland to Bayeux. High winds made it difficult to establish a beachhead and the amphibious assault did not begin until 7:30 a.m. However heavy bombardment disabled three of the four large German guns covering the beach.</p>
            <p>Due to stiff German resistance, Bayeux was not captured until June 7. British casualties at Gold are estimated at 1,000â€“1,100. German casualties are unknown.</p>

          <div class="mapInfo" id="info5">
            <h2>Juno Beach</h2>
            <p>The objective at Juno ws to seize the Carpiquet airport west of Caen and link up with the invasion forces at Gold and Sword. The beach was defended by two German battalions and a panzer division, making it the second most heavily defended beaches on D-Day.</p>
            <p>The landings encountered heavy early resistance and early ship bombardment was ineffective at breaking up the German forces. The push inland towards Carpiquet achieved mixed results with the sheer number of forces on the beach delaying reinforcements. However by 11 p.m., the invasion force had reached its objectives and succeeded in pushing farther inland than any other landing force on D-Day.</p>

          <div class="mapInfo" id="info6">
            <h2>Sword Beach</h2>
            <p>Sword was the easternmost landing site of the Normandy Invasion. Sword was divided into several sectors with each sector divided into beaches. Sword is located about 9 miles from Caen, the goal of the 3rd Infantry Division.</p>
            <p>The Sword landing suffered few casualties but it's route inland suffered from traffic congestion that limited the invasion's effectiveness. Troops at Sword experienced the only armour counter-attack of D-Day, mounted by the 21st Panzer Division.</p>
