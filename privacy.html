This includes the European Directive on Data Protection. Dir 95/45/EC and the Privacy and Electronic Directive Dir. 2002/58/EC.</p>
          <h4>Purpose</h4>
          <p>As set forth above, various national and international laws and regulations protect the rights of individuals in connection with data relating to them. These rights include the right of a person to make sure that data about them is accurate, is processed fairly and lawfully, is kept secure and is only disclosed to others with their consent under agreed circumstances.</p>
          <p>The purpose of this Policy is to document Travel Amore' continuing commitment to ensuring that the aims of national and international laws and regulations on data protection, including but not limited to those set forth above, are respected and that the collection, processing, use and disclosure of data by Travel Amore is compliant with those laws and regulations.</p>
          <p>As a global travel management company, Travel Amore, among other things, receives data from within and outside the United States, including but not limited to the EU and delivers that data to its customers and other third parties in various formats; all at the request of and by agreement with its customers.</p>
          <h4>Scope of this Policy</h4>
          <p>This Policy applies to Travel Amore' operations throughout the world. Where local laws and regulations which go beyond the scope of this Policy apply to the collection, processing, use and disclosure of data, then these may be included in an appendix to this Policy, which will specify the location to which it applies. In that location, the additional provisions of the relevant appendix will be observed along with all of the other provisions of the Policy.</p>

          <h4>Adherence to Primary Principles of Privacy Shield</h4>
          <h5>Notice, Choice and Accountability for Onward Transfer</h5>
          <p>Travel Amore will inform its customers and business partners (e.g., vendors and other third parties) that it participates in the Privacy Shield. It will provide such notice in a variety of manners as may be appropriate, such as, language in its contracts with customers, clear notification on its website (https://Travel Amore.github.io/privacy-policy.html), and a specific link to this policy that can be easily found. Travel Amore personal data may include, but is not limited to, information such as name, address, age, marital status, medical conditions, passport and visa information and corporate data.</p>

          <p>Travel Amore provides travel management services and reporting to corporate clients (typically, a Data Controller). In order to provide these services, Travel Amore requires Personal Data regarding persons authorized to travel for the client (the "Data Subjects") hereinafter referred to as the "Traveler" or "Travelers". This data may be collected from the Traveler, from the client, or from other sources such as travel agents.

Travel Amore does not exercise any control over the use of personal information transmitted using global distribution systems or other travel suppliers. As of the Effective Date, Travel Amore provides Traveler travel information to iJET/ISOS for travel risk management as well as to DataFlex for credit card reconciliation. Otherwise, travel arrangements are shared only with the client for whom the Traveler works.</p>

          </ul>
