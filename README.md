# TravelAmore.github.io
Travel Amore is an imaginary company. The Travel Amore website was created by Sherrie Teague in partial completion of the requirements of online class titled Intro to Web Page Design - CISM 2123 at Northwest Arkansas Community College. 

V1.0-beta has all required features but there were some issues remaining to be fixed. The assignment deadline came and I had to submit it as is.
 
My professor gave me a score of 97% and said:+ Excellent use of images throughout site.

+ ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Great implementation of the slideshow feature.

+ Good integration of the image map functionality into the map markers.

+ Appropriate use of CSS3 features.

+ Good job going above and beyond the project requirements and implementing functionality that we haven't explicitly discussed in the course.

+ Some elements could use a bit of tweaking in mobile view, but overall you've done a pretty good job on the responsive design.

﻿﻿- Navicon visible in desktop view.

- Navicon and expanding navigation not functioning in mobile.  Unsure what intention was for this, but would at minimum recommend moving the navigation toward the top of the page for mobile.

- Some hyperlinks, (e.g. those on honeymoon page right side) are styled similar to regular text.  This makes them difficult to locate.

= Overall, you did an excellent job on the final project, Sherrie.  Good attention to project requirements, and well done on implementing features outside of those requirements.
